OauthProject
============

Oauth client and server

It is just a exercise for my course Mobile Services Design from University of Jyväskylä.
I develop a Oauth 1.0.a receipes provider (in php) and an App for Android which uploads and shows recipes.
Considerations:
-The main purpose of this project is to understand, learn and develop a client and provider using Oauth 1.0.a
-The provider server is bad designed, it is not scalable. I didn't use classes and I didn't like too much how Slim framework works.
-Test are not include, but everything apperantly work.
